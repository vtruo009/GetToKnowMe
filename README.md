# What Are We? ðŸ¤¨

This is a simple quiz app that allows people to get to know me a bit better. The objective was to build a simple app referencing Codecademy's CodeHistory app to get some hands-on experience with SwiftUI and iOS Development. In addition to Swift and SwiftUI basics, this project also provided the opportunity to get some experience with the `Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)` design pattern.
